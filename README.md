# Building a Programming Language

My notes for Building [Building a Programming Language](https://classpert.com/classpertx/courses/building-a-programming-language/cohort)

TODO:
- Stacked unary operators, right exponents -> Using right recursive. Unary has higher precedence
- Binary/Hex/Decimal notation, maybe arbitrary base
- Binary operators?
